# Fashion-Group-Dashboard-Excel
- Data on fashion groups' sales in Australia was contained in an Excel file. 
- Each sheet has a pivot table that can be used to generate a chart that can then be utilized in the dashboard sheet. 
- The dashboard is fully interactive and includes a slicer. 
- When you want to add new data to the same table, the data is first converted into a table that delivers dynamic updates in the chart and pivot table.
